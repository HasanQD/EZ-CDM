# EZ-CDM
This repository contains code for the article: \
Qarehdaghi, H., & Rad, J. A. (2022). EZ-CDM for modeling continuous decisions by everyone! Fast, simple, robust, and accurate estimation of circular diffusion model parameters. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rzqhg

- [Tururial for fitting the Robust EZ-CDM](https://github.com/HasanNath/EZ-CDM/blob/main/Robust%20EZ-CDM.ipynb)
- [Tururial for fitting the mixed model of CDM and guess](https://github.com/HasanNath/EZ-CDM/blob/main/Mixed%20model%20of%20the%20CDM%20and%20guess.ipynb)

Codes are in Python but hopefully, they are simple enough for translating to other programming languages.\
Any question or comment is welcomed! ðŸ˜Š

One other thing. A quick presentation of this work at the 2022 meeting of the society for mathematical psychology is available here: https://mathpsych.org/presentation/742
