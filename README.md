# EZ-CDM
This repository constains code for the article ...

- [Tururial for fitting Simple EZ-CDM](https://github.com/HasanNath/EZ-CDM/blob/main/Simple%20EZ-CDM.ipynb)
- [Tururial for fitting Robust EZ-CDM](https://github.com/HasanNath/EZ-CDM/blob/main/Robust%20EZ-CDM.ipynb)
- [Tururial for fitting the mixed model of CDM and guess](https://github.com/HasanNath/EZ-CDM/blob/main/Mixed%20model%20of%20the%20CDM%20and%20guess.ipynb)

Codes are in python but hopefully they are siple enough for translating to other pogramming langueages.
Any question or comment is welcomed. :smile:
